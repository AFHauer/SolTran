Solute Transport Modeling in R Shny Application

This is a current work in progress for my MSBA Capstone Project at the University of Montana. 
The primary idea is to develop a web application which allows for the uploading of hydrologic, 
nutrient cycling, and limnologic repertory functions, and runs solute transportation models based on those data. 

This work largely works off models developed by Robert Runkel at the USGS in Denver, CO, 
and Robert Hensley and Matthew Cohen at the University of Florida.

This web application is developed in R shiny.
